    "title": "VA Loan Guaranty - Guaranty Remittance REST API",
    "description": "<p>The Guaranty Remittance API lets lenders streamline part of their post-closing operations by avoiding the need to manually input data or perform other operations. This API lets lenders:</p><ul><li>Obtain ​​feedback on the loan's funding fee amount and conformance to important aspects of VA policy before closing the loan​​​</li><li>Submit ​a closed loan for guaranty, allowing VA to​ provide feedback on VA policy conformance and calculate the appropriate funding fee amount</li><li>Remit the VA funding fee</li><li>Receive the Loan Guaranty Certificate (LGC)</li><li>Add evidence that loan policy violations were remediated</li></ul><h2>Background</h2><p>Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) helps service members, Veterans, and eligible surviving spouses become homeowners. As part of our mission to serve Veterans, we provide a home loan guaranty benefit and other housing-related programs to help Veterans buy, build, repair, retain, or adapt a home for personal occupancy.</p><p>VA home loans are provided by private lenders, such as banks and mortgage companies. VA guarantees a portion of the loan, enabling the lender to provide Veterans with more favorable terms.</p><p>The VA funding fee is a one-time payment that the Veteran, service member, or survivor pays on a VA-backed or VA direct home loan. This fee helps lower the cost of the loan for U.S. taxpayers since the VA home loan program doesn't require down payments or monthly mortgage insurance.</p><h2>Technical Overview</h2><p>You can learn about how the VA Home Loan Guaranty process works by visiting the <a href=\"https://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/technology-knowledge-center.asp\">Home Loans Technology Knowledge Center</a> website. Specific, detailed technical information related to, but not required for, using this API can be found in our <a href=\"https://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/documents/tech/gr-api-companion.pdf\">companion document</a>.</p><h2>Authentication and Authorization</h2><p>​​​The authentication model for the Guaranty Remittance API is based on OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect and supports the <a href=\"https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/guaranty-remittance/client-credentials\">client credentials grant</a>.</p><p><b>Important:</b> To get production access, you must either work for VA or have specific VA agreements in place. If you have questions, contact us.</p><h2>Test Data</h2><p>The database powering our sandbox environment is populated with test Veteran and loan data. Sandbox test data mimics real Veteran data but contains no protected health information or personally identifiable information. Data is not sent upstream and it is not necessary to align submitted test data with any other system data.</p>",
