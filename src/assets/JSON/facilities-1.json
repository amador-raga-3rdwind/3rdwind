{"openapi":"3.0.1","info":{"title":"VA Facilities","description":"## Background\n\nThe VA Facilities API version 1 (v1) provides information about VA facilities, including locations, addresses, phone numbers, hours of operation, and available services.\n\nVA operates several different types of facilities. This API gives information about:\n- Health facilities (vha)\n- Benefits facilities (vba)\n- Cemeteries (nca)\n- Vet Centers (vc)\n\n## Technical Overview\n\nHealth service data for v1 of this API is based on both real-time and historical data.\n\n- Historical data is returned for the previous 30 days. Data is based on both pending and completed appointments for a given facility.\n- Service-related data may be added, removed, or modified by an authorized individual at the data facility. These data changes are available to v1 of this API in real time.\n\n\n### Authentication and Authorization\n\nAPI requests are authorized through a symmetric API token provided in an HTTP header named apikey.\n\n### Test data\n\nTest data for the sandbox environment is only for testing the API and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date. After testing this API in sandbox, you can start the process of moving to production.\n\n### Facility ID formats\n\nA facility ID has the format prefix_stationNumber. The prefix is nca, vc, vba, or vha. Cemeteries may be VA national cemeteries or non-national; non-national cemeteries have the station number prefixed with an s. There are no other constraints on the format. Some facility ID examples are:\n- Health: `vha_402GA`\n- Benefits: `vba_539GB`\n- National cemetery: `nca_063`\n- Non-national cemetery: `nca_s1082`\n- Vet Center: `vc_0872MVC`\n\n\n### Service Ids\n\nServices within the API are identified with a unique `serviceId` which are used by some endpoints. These identifiers will never change. To see all service ids currently active, use the `/facilities` endpoint to return a listing of all facilities in the API. The service ids can be found in the `services` section of the results\n\n\n### Mobile Facilities\n\nThe mobile health facilities move regularly within a region. If a facility comes back from this API with \"mobile\": \"true\", the latitude/longitude and address could be inaccurate. To get the exact current location, please call the mobile facility number listed.","contact":{"name":"developer.va.gov"},"version":"1.0.0"},"tags":[{"name":"facilities","description":"VA Facilities API"}],"paths":{"/facilities":{"get":{"tags":["facilities"],"summary":"Query facilities based on optional parameters such as location or ID.","description":"Query facilities with a combination of optional search parameters.\n\n- A query with no search parameters will return all facilities in the response. \n\n- A query by bounding box returns all facilities within a geographic area bounded by the given positions. The ordering of the coordinate pairs may be in any order. \n\n- A query by latitude and longitude returns all facilities matching other given parameters, sorted by distance from that location. If either `lat` or `long` are supplied, both must be given. Providing an optional `radius` in miles to this query will narrow the scope of the returned facilities to those falling within the specified radius from that location. Radius may only be supplied if both lat and long are present.\n\n- If one wishes to only get facilities with specific ids, simply include a comma separated list like `?facilityIds=id1,id2`. When requesting multiple facilities by ID, the API will return as many results as it can find matches for given other included parameters, omitting ids where there is no match. As per the JSON API specification, unrecognized IDs will not result in a returned error but rather simply not return a result for that ID. Clients may supply IDs up to the limit their HTTP client enforces for URI path lengths. (Usually 2048 characters.)\n\n- Results are paginated. The default page size is 10. Pagination can be modified by specifying `page` and/or `per_page` parameters up to a maximum page size of 1000. JSON responses include pagination information in the standard JSON API  \"links\" and \"meta\" elements. \n\n","operationId":"GET:/facilities","parameters":[{"name":"facilityIds","in":"query","description":"List of comma separated ids.
